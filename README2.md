I ventured into IT and telecommunications a little over three years ago, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and halfway through my career as a systems analyst. I am passionate about data analysis and management and Data Science, as well as cloud-based software development, artificial intelligence, web development and responsive websites.
I am constantly looking to evolve my skills and expand my knowledge as a web analyst and developer.
